# Accenture_Interview
Code for my Accenture Interview

This code was used for my Autonomous Boat Project and designed in Tinkercad using C++ for Arduino.

Assignment Objective:
Develop a scale model of an autonomous boat with differential steering that is capable of self-navigation and obstacle avoidance. The boat will communicate with a LabVIEW-based interface for sensor data and control signals, and include a manual override feature.
